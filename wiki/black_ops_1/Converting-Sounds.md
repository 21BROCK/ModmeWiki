# Converting Sound Files

## Required Tool
In this tutorial we use a tool called [BassDrop](http://aviacreations.com/wraith/#utilities-view) which is provided free.

## Getting Started
First we recommend preparing your sound file for World at War as the sound tool doesn't work with all audio formats, so please follow this tutorial first [World at War] [Converting Sounds](https://wiki.modme.co/TODO_Link_WAW_SOUNDS!!)

## Converting to Black Ops
First, modify the settings so they corrospond with the audio file type you have, the following are the options:
- ADPCM (Used for music and audio)
- XWMA (Used for weapon sounds, etc)
- Looping (Only specify this if the sound will loop in the alias)

Finally `drag and drop` your already made audio files onto the UI and they'll convert into the `bo_ready` folder.

> **NOTE:** You can't natively play these files.

After that you can use those files in your mod.

## Converting to Playable Format
Again, just `drag and drop` Black Ops sound files (Or game FastFiles) onto the UI and they will convert to the `normal` folder. These files can be edited and played natively on your PC.

1.  Converting Sound Files

1.  Required Tool
In this tutorial we use a tool called [BassDrop](http://aviacreations.com/wraith/#utilities-view) which is provided free.

1.  Getting Started
First we recommend preparing your sound file for World at War as the sound tool doesn't work with all audio formats, so please follow this tutorial first [World at War] [[Converting Sounds|http://phabricator.aviacreations.com/w/world_at_war/converting_sounds/]].

1.  Converting to Black Ops
First, modify the settings so they corrospond with the audio file type you have, the following are the options:
- ADPCM (Used for music and audio)
- XWMA (Used for weapon sounds, etc)
- Looping (Only specify this if the sound will loop in the alias)

Finally `drag and drop` your already made audio files onto the UI and they'll convert into the `bo_ready` folder.

NOTE: You can't natively play these files.

After that you can use those files in your mod.

1.  Converting to Playable Format
Again, just `drag and drop` Black Ops sound files (Or game FastFiles) onto the UI and they will convert to the `normal` folder. These files can be edited and played natively on your PC.

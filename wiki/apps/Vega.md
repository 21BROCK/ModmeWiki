Using Vega is fairly simple as the tool only requires the files located within "base" in order to function.

- The tool features a user interface, just open up a resource file using `Load File`

> **IMPORTANT:** Both the tool and the game **require** the entirety of the base folder to be intact and must not be modified in any way.

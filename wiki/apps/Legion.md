## Usage:
Using Legion is fairly simple as the tool only requires the files located within "Apex\paks\Win64" in order to function.
> **IMPORTANT:** Both the tool and the game **require** the entirety of the Win64 folder to be intact and must not be modified in any way.

- The tool supports Drag and Drop functionality, supported file formats are ONLY the **.rpak** extensions.

## Command Line:
- By default, Legion exports textures and data tables.
- To switch mode to models add:
  - `--exportmdl` as the first argument.
  - `--mdlfmt=obj` switches the model format.
    - Formats: [obj, smd, xnatxt, xnabin, xmodel, maya, fbx] semodel is default.
- To switch mode to animations add:
  - `--exportanim` as the first argument.
- To change the image format add:
  - `--imgfmt=png` switches the image format.
    - Formats: [png, tiff] dds is default.
- After these arguments, just pass the path to the rpak.
- Full example:
  - `--exportmdl --mdlfmt=smd "C:\path\to\apex\paks\Win64\common.rpak"`

> **IMPORTANT:** The tool **AUTO LOADS** the patch rpak files, just specify the base one and it will handle the rest.

> **NOTE:** Not all (0X).rpak files are patches, some can be loaded directly, just try them.

## Ripping:
- The **.rpak** files contain various encoded assets that Legion can export; and, as of now the currently supported assets are:
  - Textures as [Dds, Png, Tiff]
  - DataTables as a CSV file.
  - Models as [SEModel, OBJ, XNALara, SMD, CoD XModel, Maya (Legacy), Kaydara FBX].
  - Animations as [SEAnim].
  
## Notice:
- SE* formats (SEModel, SEAnim are preferred over any other export format and have guaranteed compatibility).

  *Setting up a buildtable:**

First download the buildtable prefab [here](https://mega.nz/#!VFR2UbqL!OTXZB2DDO0VoUNeIplapGwVnIfJMZEv43-rX_j4a0-8).

Place it in `BlackOps3Root/map_source/_prefabs/`.

Feel free to change the geometry/model for it, just keep the trigger aligned.

You can place as many of them as you like without modification.

  *Setting up the rocket shield:**

First download the spawner prefab [here](https://mega.nz/#!ZYh0zYIS!DSxcXxZc9g5coDs8zPTet9mHEZoIOyP6kwpG1fqSM20).

Place it in `BlackOps3Root/map_source/_prefabs/`. You must only add this **once** and you should place it **under your entire map**.

Next download the following piece prefabs:

 - Eagle Part: [download](https://mega.nz/#!9EoRUYjI!AxQlvqvGAQr3dVRIKCFHJ7XWGabV_ufGAm5ZZTuxXeg)
 - Gas Part: [download](https://mega.nz/#!1RpRlaRR!qnavIpA-D29Ho7x1km_TqOaDODM9jcUWbxU708phnu0)
 - Window Part: [download](https://mega.nz/#!tcBizAgZ!SA9agTqG79bnJxES1qJXKsnjw-KoHZAhW93XruvsYyg)
 - Refillable tank spawn: [download](https://mega.nz/#!8JAyCajL!2afuJR00_j_Yczk0wH78-G9IYRRkg1dGcSP_zRu1eoI)

Place all of them in `BlackOps3Root/map_source/_prefabs/`. You can place as many spawners of them as you'd like **but you need at least one of each!**

Also, you can change the model tag on the part to change the shield's look if you like.

First download the already made prefabs here:

 - Start box and 9 placements: [Download](https://mega.nz/#!IAQHUDIC!xLLfl8RC1GLdReUNh4AHDDoEaGygDt1ChT5iDBUJbpo)

First place only one of the start box locations. After that you can place as many alternate prefabs as you want. If you want to add more than 9, just change the KVP on the alternate from `chest_x_` to another number each time to allow for more locations.

IMPORTANT: When you rename the box KVP don't use `03`, it must be `3` (i.e. single digits) and so on. Also, save the edit to a new prefab.
 
You can now rebuild the map and use the box.

First download the aleady made prefabs here:

 - Actor prefab: [download](https://mega.nz/#!tEonwRZC!B1qVg_cyicT0GZqv20qW4Dmut-0Fq4C_gUnvYTJOEzQ)
 - Spawner prefab: [download](https://mega.nz/#!4YYzSDwC!fogODUgRtXItLoO-GIuC3M2BrbtEukOA0JS4SWAm7G0)

Next you must place only **one** actor prefab in the map, this allows you to spawn dogs in general.

Then add as many spawn prefabs as you want, you can modify the KVP's to change the active zone that it is for (the prefab is set to the test map's start zone).

You can now rebuild the map and run dog rounds!

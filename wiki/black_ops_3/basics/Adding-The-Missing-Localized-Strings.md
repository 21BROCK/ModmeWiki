  *Instructions**

    - Download the files and extract them into your root directory ( Root directory is your Black Ops 3 install )

    - Add this line to your zone

`localize,zombie`

  *You are DONE**

The strings for things that were missing before - eg when you held the rocket shield it would say ZOMBIE_ROCKET_HINT ( Can tell its a localized as will be in ALL CAPS and prob start with ZOMBIE_ ) should now be correct

If you find any still not working, contact me and I will add them

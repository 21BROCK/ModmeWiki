*Instructions*
  
- Download the files and extract them into your root directory ( Root directory is your Black Ops 3 install )

*You are DONE*

Now you can set the proper rumble types on your weapon files instead of using smg_fire on everything. These can also be used in script, but would most likely need adding to your zone to do so

1.  Converting Sound Files

1.  Required Tool
In this tutorial we use a tool called [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/) which is provided free.

1.  Getting Started
Go ahead and open your source file, `audacity` can handle a lot of input files. Once open you'll notice the `track and a waveform` of the current file.

First off at the bottom left of your screen change the `sample rate to 44100`, this makes the project setting change to the rate we need. See below for an example.

Next go to the arrow at the top left of the current track and select `Rate->44100`.

{F3271}

> Note: If your sound file is already mono, you can continue to saving. Otherwise follow along below.

1.  Converting from Stereo to Mono
To convert from a `stereo to a mono track` you need to go to the arrow again at the top left of the current track and press `Split stereo to mono` This will create two separate tracks for you.

Now select both tracks using `shift` and go to `Track->Mix and render`, you will now see one combined track that will be `mono`.

{F3275}

1.  Saving the File
To save the file simply go to `File->Export Audio`, select `Wave and then signed 16 PCM`, This will provide a medium quality audio file.

You'll be presented with another dialog for file tags but be sure to ignore them and just continue, the file will have saved and it's ready for `Call of Duty: World at War` or conversion using the `Black Ops sound tool`.
